# Windows Firewall Notifier Lite (WFN Lite)

## Project Description
This project is based on Windows Firewall Notifier (WFN), which can be found at https://github.com/wokhansoft/WFN

WFN started as an "extension" to the embedded Windows firewall, and WFN Lite is a stripped-down version containing only the notification functionality.

Please read the documentation about the features and limitation of WFN and WFN Lite. Especially note that WFN Lite is **not** a firewall itself; it is only an extension of the Windows Firewall!

## Requirements
WFN Lite is tested on an up-to-date Windows 10 64-bit machine with the latest .NET framework installed. It may run on older set-ups too, but this is not guaranteed.

## Donations (or _"How can I show how much I like this project?"_)
